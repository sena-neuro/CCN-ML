What are the regulatory mechanisms? How would the distinction between synapses that should stop working and synapses that should not stop working be done? Is it related to the usage of these synapses? How?

Closure ratio - regulation of proteins 
Inhibitory problem with syncam1 - responses when removing syncam1 - visual acuity 
Specialized vision with the existence of the proteins in the place
No orientation selectivity

Binocular vision has problems with depth perception
Results of the critical period with syncam1 mouse
Thalamic connections are problematic
Synapses driving the neutralization
Thalamic input, prevalumin provides inhibition
Feed forward inhibition is immature in the absence of SynCAM1 

What is the interaction between neurons when keeping synapses?
Why the fuck?
Why do you think is based on one neuron and not in groups of neurons?
Proteins working together to create an environment?

Manipulation after the critical period
