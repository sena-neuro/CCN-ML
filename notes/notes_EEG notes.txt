Explanation: 

* SVM
	- transform data to the format of an SVM package 
		(categorical features)
	- conduct simple scaling on the data 
	- consider the RBF kernel K(x,y)= e^(-Gamma(||x-y||)^2)
	- use cross-validation to find the best parameter C and Gamma(Grid Search)
	- use the best parameter C and Gamma to train the whole training set
	- Test
	
	Common mistakes:
	- scaling with different scalers
	- knowing when to use liblinear (too many features or instances)
	
	- data : https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/
	
* scikit-learn library 
	- negative <= five fold cross validation for estimates
	- scaling data required
	- C << 1 if there is noise in the data
	- L1 penalization
	- uses libsvm underneath, implemented in c

* T5 and T3 channels are used to check migraine in general. 
* International 10-20 system for placing of electrodes 
* Increased amplitude of F1 component => steady state visual evoked potential (VEP)

* Frequency bands for EEG
- delta (0.5-4 Hz) <= epilepsy (low frequency)
- theta (4-8 Hz)   <= epilepsy (high amplitude)
- alpha (8-13 Hz)  <= migraine, epilepsy
- beta (13-30 Hz)  <= migraine

- epilepsy = delta and theta activity (low frequency and high amplitude range)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Migraine related: 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Incidence of paroxysmal discharges, typical of epileptic syndromes, has been identified. 
High rates of epileptic EEG activity have been depicted in chronic headache. 
EEG finding of migraine attacks have verified sequences of spikes or sharp waves in different brain regions, similar to the ictal recording of epilepsy. 
MIGRAINE: H-response: During headache-free intervals, the most consistent abnormality reported with migraine is a flash driving response at frequencies greater than 20 Hz.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Depression related:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The increased variability of anterior EEG asymmetry can be used as a characteristic feature or marker for depression detection from EEG signal. 
- The effects of drugs include accentuation of beta activity, background slowing with decreased amplitude and frequency of the alpha rhythm, and intermixed theta and delta activity rhythm, and intermixed theta and delta activity.

Three Dimension 3D Signal for Electroencephalographic (EEG)
==================================================================

Preprocessing
	= threshold (removal of artifacts)
	= band pass filter ( raw signal into sub bands)
	= short time fourier transform (stft) (get the EEG spectogram)
Image processing (produce 3D signal from EEG)
	= color conversion (gray color)
	= optimization 
	= gradient and mesh algorithms (produce 3D signal)
	
Signal(time,amplitude,power)

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one sum of different sinusoids with a fairly wide frequency spectrum which is divided into a differenct frequency bands named delta, theta, alpha and beta bands. 
These bands, spectral components, represent EEG oscillations and are hypothesized to reflect cyclical variation in the excitability of neuronal assemblies. 

beta  = activity, thinking
alpha = relax, closed eye
theta = light sleep, emotional stress
delta = profound sleep

In this papers there was not much useful information.

Parameters analyzed of Higuchi's fractal dimension for EEG brain signals
=========================================================================

Fractal Dimension analysis to quantify the irregularity of complexity of brain signals(Higuchi's algorithm) - sensitivity of k parameter due to segmentation, overlap and noise over a signal. 
Wilcoxon signed-rank test - analysis of statistical differences.
 
Aim 1: Analyze the influence of the overlap, segmentation, different values of theoretical FD over noise data. 
Aim 2: According to k, compare and analyze statistical differences between different cognitive tasks. 

Surrogate data technique

Higuchi's Algorithm: 
1. Construct new time series
2. Calculate length of each new curve of time series
3. Calculate mean length of each curve
4. Check if curve is fractal with dimension FD.

EEG alpha oscillations: The inhibition-timing hypothesis.
===========================================================

1. ERD (Event related desynchronization) - release of inhibition associated with the emergence of complex spreading activation processes.
2. ERS (Event related synchronization) - withhold or control the execution of a response (top-down inhibitory control) - timing of cortical processing

Oscillations reflect rhythmic changes in the relative level of depolarization in the membrane potentials of masses of neurons.
