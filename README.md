# CCN-ML
=========================

CCN_Python is the code that the Cognitive Computational Neuroscience Laboratory in Bilkent has been gathering related to EEG data. 
This source code can be used for data input/output, preprocessing, vizualization and machine learning processes (computer-based statistics). 
This code was mostly inspired from MNE-Python library which does the wanted functionality but was later changed so that it fits the needs of the lab. For a more extensive version of the functionality visit : https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python .
